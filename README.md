Part #1

Create a script that should do the following:

ask the user their year of birth;
ask them where they live;
ask them their favorite sport.
When you click OK, we show a window where the following information should be displayed:

his age;

if the user specifies Kyiv, Washington or London, then show him the message - "You live in the capital..." and in place of the dots we substitute the country whose capital is the city. Otherwise, we show him "you live in the city...", where the dots are the entered city.
Part #2

We choose three sports and three champions in these sports. Accordingly, if the user selects one of these sports, we show him the message “Cool! Do you want to become …? and substitute the first and last name of the champion in place of the dots.

All this should be displayed in one window (alert).

If in some case he does not want to enter the information and clicks Cancel, show him a message – “It’s a pity that you did not want to enter your …” and indicate that he did not want to enter – date of birth, city or sport.
